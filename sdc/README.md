# Science Data Catalog 2 - ElasticSearch/React Front End Application

This is the repository for the Science Data Catalog version 2.  It uses the JavaScript React framework which connects to a hosted ElasticSearch Application at https://bonsai.io/   The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Basic setup:
After checkking out the repo for the first time, you will need to install your node dependencies locally before you can run sdc.  The node_modules directory contains thousands of files and thus it is included in .gitignore.

1.  Check out the repo
2.  In the project directory, run ```npm install``` - this will install the required node modules.


## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`
